# millet-schedule-project
The goal of this project is to help a small business owner semi-automate manual and time consuming administrative tasks 
relating to staffing schedules, time tracking by the staff, verification of staff hours etc. using Excel, Excel forms and VBA coding.

Malia is an expert Excel user with limited VBA coding experience.

This Excel Workbook solution is being created on my own time at no additional expense to the business owner.
